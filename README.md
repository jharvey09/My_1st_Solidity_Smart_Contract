### Background
Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating a few ProfitSplitter contracts. These contracts will do several things:

Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.

Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.

Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.

**Files**
AssociateProfitSplitter.sol -- Level 1 starter code.

TieredProfitSplitter.sol -- Level 2 starter code.

DeferredEquityPlan.sol -- Level 3 starter code.

**Instructions**
This assignment has 3 levels of difficulty, with each contract increasing in complexity and capability. Start with Level 1, then move forward as you complete the challenges. You can build all three with the skills you already have!

*Level One* is an AssociateProfitSplitter contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

*Level Two* is a TieredProfitSplitter that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

*Level Three* is a DeferredEquityPlan that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
